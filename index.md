# Gesture Controlled Robot
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

For my first milestone, I assembled the Chassi Car (the robot I will be controlling later on), wired the electronics that make it move, and completed some Arduino test code to configure the pins for future use. As a result, the robot moves! Through my code and assembly, I was able to get it moving forward and backward. This experience was extremely new to me as I've never worked with electronics OR Arduino independently, but I've already learned so much in the span of a week. 

*Key materials used:* Arduino UNO, Chassi Car, Screwdriver, Wire Kit, Breadboard, H-Bridges

*Challenges*: It was difficult to get my test code working as I didn't configure my pins effectively, resulting in one of my wheels moving in the wrong direction with every method call. Some debugging fixed the problem though, and it was interesting to see how hardware and software interact!

*Next steps:* For my second milestone, I hope to assemble the controller powered by gestures and write its code. If I complete this in time, I hope to make a modification and also make my car look more aesthetically pleasing through concealing the wiring. 

**Test Code for Milestone 1**
```c++

// this is for h-bridge 1
const int AIA_1 = 4;
const int AIB_1 = 5; 
const int BIA_1 = 2;
const int BIB_1 = 3;

// this is for h-bridge 2
const int AIA_2 = 9;
const int AIB_2 = 8;
const int BIA_2 = 11;
const int BIB_2 = 10;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(AIA_1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(AIB_1, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(BIA_1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BIB_1, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(AIA_2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(AIB_2, OUTPUT);

  pinMode(BIA_2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BIB_2, OUTPUT);
  
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  forward();
 delay(2000);
 backward();
 delay(2000);
}

void backward()
{
  digitalWrite(AIA_1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(AIA_2, LOW);

  digitalWrite(AIB_1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(AIB_2, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(BIA_1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(BIA_2, LOW);

  digitalWrite(BIB_1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(BIB_2, HIGH);
}
void forward()
{

  digitalWrite(AIA_1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(AIA_2, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(AIB_1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(AIB_2, LOW);

  digitalWrite(BIA_1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(BIA_2, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(BIB_1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(BIB_2, LOW);

}

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Final Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
